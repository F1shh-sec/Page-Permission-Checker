# Page-Permission-Checker
 This is a quick and easy script I threw together to check weather a user account has permission to access a page. 

# How to use
Create a list of websites and store it in text.txt. New items should be seperated by a new line. 

Add any cookies you need for authentication to the Cookies section, and any HTML headers you need to he header section.

Run the script and await results.
